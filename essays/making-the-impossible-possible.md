## Making the impossible possible

In the last couple of years I have worked with various teams on different software development projects. One of the most time-demanding tasks for these projects has been do scan through and understand the code another developer has written. However, this has often become a nearly impossible task where the developer's coding standards is not consistent with the team and sometimes not even with himself. An example is when I tried reading a code where the programmer was not consistent with the use of separate naming conventions for local functions and global functions. Then it became a unnecessary difficult task to task to understand which functions was to be reused in other modules and the functions that was intented to be helper-functions inside the module. This has made me understand the importance of having a set of coding standards for the language you are using in order to prevent a complex codebase structure and potentially angry colleagues.

As mentioned, I have become an intermediate software developer after contributing to several projects over the last couple of years. However, (surprisingly enough) I have never written or read much JavaScript code. Therefore, I have been blessed by the linter ESLint that has given me a lot of errors and made me aware of my run-time errors as well as the possible flaws of my code quality and readability. I have changed my "==" to "===" and my "lets" to "const". ESLint also discovered my redundant "else"-statement after a return in an if which I was rather impressed by. The rules ESLint provides for code practices, variables and styling has made it easier for me to understand beauty and possibilities of using JavaScript. I also believe that a code integration will go smoother in a team where everyone has installed ESLint.
