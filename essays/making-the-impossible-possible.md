## Making the impossible possible

In the last couple of years I have worked with various teams on different software development projects. One of the most time-demanding tasks for these projects has been do scan through and understand the code another developer has written. However, this has sometimes even become a nearly impossible tasks where the developer's coding standards is not consistent with the team and sometimes not even with himself. This has made me understand the importance of having a set of coding standards for the language you are writing in order to prevent a complex codebase structure and angry colleagues.
