# Just another trophy for my collection?

As a 4th year computer-science student, I have developed software in programming languages like C++, C, C#, Go, Python and Java. It might upset many web-developers out there that Javascript is yet to be presented on my programming trophy-collection. I was therefore thrilled to find out that the ICS-314 class gives me the opportunity to get front-end Javascript-experience and the possibility to discover a potential new favorite programming-language.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77788918/131767650-20a8faf9-213b-4d8c-9434-7ebcdeb8d50e.png)
