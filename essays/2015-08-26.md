# Just another trophy for my collection? 
As a 4th year computer-science student, I have developed software in programming languages like C++, C, C#, Go, Python and Java. It might upset many web-developers out there that JavaScript is yet to be added to my programming trophy-collection. I was therefore thrilled to find out that the ICS-314 class gives me the opportunity to get front-end JavaScript-experience and the possibility to discover a potential new favorite programming-language.  

## First thoughts from a low-level programmer perspective 
Last week I completed an introductory course in JavaScript. An important finding from the course was JavaScriptâ€™s vast amount of functionality and the simplicity of exploiting it. It is seemingly also an easy language to learn for experienced programmers with similar syntax as other commonly used languages. However, it was fascinating to experience a first-class language, where functions can be stored in variables and passed in as an argument. Functions inside of functions is said to be an advantageous feature to JavaScript which can contribute to compacting code and increasing readability. However, from a low-level programmer point of view, I am not sure if I would understand a code-base better by making functions anonymous and hiding the datatypes from their respective variables. When I am supposed to understand and reuse functions in C++, I am grateful for the required addition of the datatype of the return-variable and parameters in the function declaration. In JavaScript where no datatypes are being presented, I would have to read the function body to fully understand how I can use the function for my own project.
