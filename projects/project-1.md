In this project we implemented a real-time system for controlling n elevators in Golang. Flowchart describes how the system handles network packet loss where all peers have to acknowledge that a message has been receieved. Further description and solution to the problem can be found [here](https://github.com/ninanye/TTK4145-Heis).
