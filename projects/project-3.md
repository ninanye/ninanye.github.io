This summer we developed an 3D annotation application for Microsoft Hololens 2. We used development platform Unity 3D with C# as our programming language. Built polygons in Unity 3D with the use of trigonometry and quaternions for rotational movement. Unfortunately, the Github-repository for this tool can not be published as this project is work-related with confidential repositories.
