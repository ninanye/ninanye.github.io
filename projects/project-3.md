summary: Developed an 3D annotation-tool compatible with Microsoft Hololens 2 smart-glasses. 
---



This summer we developed an 3D annotation application for Microsoft Hololens 2. We used development-platform Unity 3D with C# as our programming language. Built polygons in Unity 3D with the use of trigonometry and quaternions for rotational movement. Currently, the project allows the user to draw in 3D with a 3D line, erase specific lines and clearing the whole space. One can also change the colour and width of the line.

Unfortunately, the Github-repository for this tool can not be published as this project is work-related with confidential repositories.
